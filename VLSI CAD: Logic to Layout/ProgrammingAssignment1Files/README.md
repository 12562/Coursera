# VLSI CAD Part I : Logic

# Introduction
  - Programming assingments on developing CAD tools using Unate Recursive Paradigm (URP) idea.
  - This repository consists of two directories: [UnateRecursiveComplement](https://github.com/12562/Coursera/tree/master/VLSI%20CAD%3A%20Logic%20to%20Layout/ProgrammingAssignment1Files/UnateRecursiveComplement) and [BooleanCalculatorEngine](https://github.com/12562/Coursera/tree/main/VLSI%20CAD%3A%20Logic%20to%20Layout/ProgrammingAssignment1Files/BooleanCalculatorEngine)
  - These tools were developed as part of programming assignment for [VLSI CAD Part I : Logic](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vlsi-cad-logic?=) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) 

## Implementation:
   - Both the Unate Recursive Complement and Boolean Calculator Engine have been implemented in C++.
